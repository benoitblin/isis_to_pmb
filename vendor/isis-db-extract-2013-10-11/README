=Description

This class will read ISIS databases created by CDS/ISIS, WinIsis or
IsisMarc. It can create array values from data in ISIS database.

It will also skip zero sized fields (OpenIsis has a bug in XS bindings, so
fields which are zero sized will be filled with random junk from memory).

This module will always be slower than OpenIsis module which use C
library. However, it's platform independent and you don't need C compiler,
and can be easily modified.
